# API Reference

This section will contain the auto-generated API documentation for the Divvi Mobile framework's public interface.

The documentation will be generated from TypeScript types and JSDoc comments in the source code.

## Coming Soon

The API reference documentation is currently under development. It will include:

- Component APIs
- Hook documentation
- Type definitions
- Context providers
- Utility functions

For now, you can explore the public interface in the `src/public` directory of the framework.
